# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose and Background
 An analyis was performed on employee data at Pewlett-Hackard to determine the number of retirement-age employees by position as well as the number of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The purpose of the analysis was to provide Pewlett-Hackard with sufficient information and data to plan for the upcoming "silver tsunami" as well as develop a mentorship program for current employees to ensure employees are properly trained and ready to step up into leadership roles.

## Analysis
### Identification of High Risk Areas
Using the available data, analysis was performed on employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 to identify retirement-age employees. Then using the list of retirement-age employees, their current job titles were identified to compile a table of the current titles held by retirement-age employees. 

Based on the analysis, the top three areas which will be affected: 
-Senior Engineers
-Senior Staff
-Engineers

An evaluation should be completed to assess and plan for future hiring as well as development programs for current employees to fill the possible upcoming positions.

### Eligibility for Mentorship Program
Using the available data, analysis was performed on employees born in 1965 to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program if Pewlett_Hackard decides to move forward on the plan. There are currently 1,549 employees who are in the appropriate age range based on the analysis. 

## Results
The implementation of a mentorship program would be a worthwhile effort to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami" as well as avoid any such occurrence in the future. Creating development programs for current employees may increase employee retention as well as attract future employees. There is currently a shortfall of employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program when compared to the group of retirement-age employees. However, that is assuming all retirement-age employees wish to retire. Retirement-age employees should be interviewed to determine the employees' timelines for retirement to collect more information about the group.
